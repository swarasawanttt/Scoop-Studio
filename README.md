Ice cream, your way.

Scoop Studio is a simple ice cream website that offers both signature flavours and customizable options, allowing users to navigate through multiple linked web pages.

## Features

- Clean and simple user interface
- Easy navigation between pages
- Hosted on a public domain using GitHub Pages

## Technologies Used

## Hosting
